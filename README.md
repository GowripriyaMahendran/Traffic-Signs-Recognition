You must have heard about the self-driving cars in which the passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. But to achieve level 5 autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.

In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

# What is Traffic Signs Recognition?üö¶

There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

# The Dataset of Python Project
# üö¶GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmarküö¶

The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

# Summary

In this Python project with source code, we have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 95% accuracy and also visualized how our accuracy and loss changes with time, which is pretty good from a simple CNN model.
